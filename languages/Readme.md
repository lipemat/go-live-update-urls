# WordPress.org Translations

Our plugin automatically loads translation from our `/languages` folder when an existing language is selected. This Readme is for adding said translation to the wordpress.org site:
1. This plugin will show up on translated versions of the wordpress.org site.
2. The language will be listed on the plugin page (not just in the description, but also in the "Languages" section).

## Plugin Code

### Process
Go to each language and import the finished `.mo` or `.po` file using the "Import Translations" link found at the bottom of the page.
